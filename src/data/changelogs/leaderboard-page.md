![Leaderboard Page](https://assets.roadmap.sh/guest/personal-dashboard.png)

We just launched a dedicated dashboard for logged-in users to showing progress, projects, bookmarks and more. You can still access the old homepage by visiting [this page](https://roadmap.sh/home).

We also launched a new [leaderboard page](/leaderboard) showing the most active users, users who completed most projects and more.

There is also a [new projects page](/projects) where you can see all the projects you have been working on. You can also now stop a started project.
