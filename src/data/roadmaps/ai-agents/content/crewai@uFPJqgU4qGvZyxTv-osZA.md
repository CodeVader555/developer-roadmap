# CrewAI

CrewAI is an open-source Python framework that lets you join several language-model agents into one team, called a crew. Each agent gets a name, a role, and a set of skills, and the library handles planning, task routing, and chat among them. To use it, you install the package, import it, define your agents in a few lines of code, link them with a Crew object, and give the crew a mission prompt. CrewAI then talks to an LLM such as OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude, passes messages between agents, runs any tools you attach, and returns a single answer. You can plug in web search, Python functions, or vector stores for memory, and you can tune settings like temperature or max tokens. Built-in logs show every step so you can debug and improve the workflow. The result is a fast way to build multi-step agent systems for tasks like research, code review, or content creation without writing a lot of low-level glue code.
