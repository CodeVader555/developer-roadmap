# Iterate and Test your Prompts

After you write a first prompt, treat it as a draft, not the final version. Run it with the AI, check the output, and note what is missing, wrong, or confusing. Change one thing at a time, such as adding an example, a limit on length, or a tone request. Test again and see if the result gets closer to what you want. Keep a record of each change and its effect, so you can learn patterns that work. Stop when the output is clear, correct, and repeatable. This loop of try, observe, adjust, and retry turns a rough prompt into a strong one.
