# Local Desktop

A Local Desktop deployment means you run the MCP server on your own computer instead of on a remote machine or cloud service. You install the MCP software, any language runtimes it needs, and the model files all on your desktop or laptop. When you start the server, it listens on a port such as 127.0.0.1:8000, which is only reachable from the same computer unless you change network settings. This setup is handy for quick tests, small demos, or private work because you control the files and can restart the server at any time. It also avoids extra cost from cloud hosting. The main limits are the power of your hardware and the fact that other people cannot reach the service unless you expose it through port forwarding or a tunnel.
