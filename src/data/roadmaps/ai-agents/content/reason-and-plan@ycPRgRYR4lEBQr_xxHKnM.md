# Reason and Plan

Reason and Plan is the moment when an AI agent thinks before it acts. The agent starts with a goal and the facts it already knows. It looks at these facts and asks, “What do I need to do next to reach the goal?” It breaks the goal into smaller steps, checks if each step makes sense, and orders them in a clear path. The agent may also guess what could go wrong and prepare backup steps. Once the plan feels solid, the agent is ready to move on and take the first action.
