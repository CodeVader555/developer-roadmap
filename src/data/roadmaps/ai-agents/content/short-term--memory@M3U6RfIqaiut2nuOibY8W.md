# Short Term  Memory

Short-term memory lets an AI agent hold recent facts while it works on a task. It keeps chat history, sensor readings, or current goals for a short time, often only for the length of one session. With this memory the agent can follow a userâ€™s last request, track the next step in a plan, or keep variables needed for quick reasoning. Once the task ends or enough time passes, most of the stored items are cleared or moved to long-term memory. Because the data is small and brief, short-term memory is fast to read and write, which helps the agent react without delay. Common ways to build it include using a sliding window over recent messages, a small key-value store, or hidden states in a neural network. Good design of short-term memory prevents the agent from forgetting vital details too soon while avoiding overload with useless data.
