# Specify Length, format etc

When you give a task to an AI, make clear how long the answer should be and what shape it must take. Say “Write 120 words” or “Give the steps as a numbered list.” If you need a table, state the column names and order. If you want bullet points, mention that. Telling the AI to use plain text, JSON, or markdown stops guesswork and saves time. Clear limits on length keep the reply focused. A fixed format makes it easier for people or other software to read and use the result. Always put these rules near the start of your prompt so the AI sees them as important.
