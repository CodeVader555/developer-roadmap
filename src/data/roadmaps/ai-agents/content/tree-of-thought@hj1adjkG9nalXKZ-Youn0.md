# Tree-of-Thought

Tree-of-Thought is a way to let an AI agent plan its steps like branches on a tree. The agent writes down one “thought” at a time, then splits into several follow-up thoughts, each leading to new branches. It can look ahead, compare branches, and drop weak paths while keeping strong ones. This helps the agent explore many ideas without getting stuck on the first answer. The method is useful for tasks that need careful reasoning, such as solving puzzles, coding, or writing. Because the agent can backtrack and revise earlier thoughts, it often finds better solutions than a straight, single-line chain of steps.
