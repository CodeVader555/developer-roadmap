# AI vs AGI

AI (Artificial Intelligence) refers to systems designed to perform specific tasks, like image recognition or language translation, often excelling in those narrow areas. In contrast, AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) would be a system capable of understanding, learning, and applying intelligence across a wide range of tasks, much like a human, and could adapt to new situations without specific programming.
