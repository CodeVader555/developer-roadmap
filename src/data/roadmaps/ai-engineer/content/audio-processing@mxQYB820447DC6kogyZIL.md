# Audio Processing

Using Multimodal AI, audio data can be processed with other types of data, such as text, images, or video, to enhance understanding and analysis. For example, it can synchronize audio with corresponding visual inputs, like lip movements in video, to improve speech recognition or emotion detection. This fusion of modalities enables more accurate transcription, better sentiment analysis, and enriched context understanding in applications such as virtual assistants, multimedia content analysis, and real-time communication systems.
