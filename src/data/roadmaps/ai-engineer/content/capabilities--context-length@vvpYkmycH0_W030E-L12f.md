# Capabilities / Context Length

OpenAI's capabilities include processing complex tasks like language understanding, code generation, and problem-solving. However, context length limits how much information the model can retain and reference during a session, affecting long conversations or documents. Advances aim to increase this context window for more coherent and detailed outputs over extended interactions.
