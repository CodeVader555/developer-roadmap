# Chat Completions API

The Chat Completions API allows developers to create conversational agents by sending user inputs (prompts) and receiving model-generated responses. It supports multiple-turn dialogues, maintaining context across exchanges to deliver relevant responses. This API is often used for chatbots, customer support, and interactive applications where maintaining conversation flow is essential.
