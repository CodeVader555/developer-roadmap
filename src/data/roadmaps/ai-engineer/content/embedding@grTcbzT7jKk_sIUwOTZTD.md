# Embedding

Embedding refers to the conversion or mapping of discrete objects such as words, phrases, or even entire sentences into vectors of real numbers. It's an essential part of data preprocessing where high-dimensional data is transformed into a lower-dimensional equivalent. This dimensional reduction helps to preserve the semantic relationships between objects. In AI engineering, embedding techniques are often used in language-orientated tasks like sentiment analysis, text classification, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to provide an understanding of the vast linguistic inputs AI models receive.
