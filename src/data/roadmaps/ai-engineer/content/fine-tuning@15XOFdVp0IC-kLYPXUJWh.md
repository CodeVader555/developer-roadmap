# Fine-tuning

OpenAI API allows you to fine-tune and adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks or datasets, improving performance on domain-specific problems. By providing custom training data, the model learns from examples relevant to the intended application, such as specialized customer support, unique content generation, or industry-specific tasks.
