# Hugging Face Models

Hugging Face Models are a set of sophisticated AI tools, primarily in Natural Language Processing (NLP), released by the Hugging Face company. They provide development and deploying capabilities for chatbots, translation, language understanding and generation, and have been widely used for research and application development. From an AI Engineer perspective, these pre-trained models can greatly reduce the time and resources necessary for developing AI applications, particularly when dealing with complex NLP tasks. As an AI engineer, understanding and knowing how to implement, fine-tune, and utilize these models is an important skill set to have.
