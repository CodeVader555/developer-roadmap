# Hugging Face

Hugging Face is often called the GitHub of machine learning because it lets developers share and test their work openly. Hugging Face is known for its `Transformers Python library`, which simplifies the process of `downloading and training ML models`. It promotes collaboration within the AI community by enabling users to `share models` and `datasets`, thus advancing the democratization of artificial intelligence through open-source practices.
