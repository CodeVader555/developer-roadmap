# Image Understanding

Image Understanding involves extracting meaningful information from images, such as photos or videos. This process includes tasks like image recognition, where an AI system is trained to recognize certain objects within an image, and image segmentation, where an image is divided into multiple regions according to some criteria. For an AI engineer, mastering techniques in Image Understanding is crucial because it forms the basis for more complex tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, or even whole scene understanding, all of which play significant roles in various AI applications. As AI technologies continue evolving, the ability to analyze and interpret visual data becomes increasingly important in fields ranging from healthcare to autonomous vehicles.
