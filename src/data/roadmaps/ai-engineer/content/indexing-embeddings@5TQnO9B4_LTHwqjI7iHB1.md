# Indexing Embeddings

Indexing embeddings is a technique often used in search systems, which allows for quick and effective retrieval of elements that are similar to a provided query. Embeddings represent high-dimensional data, such as text or images, in a lower-dimensional space, making it easier for comparison and analysis. As per the AI engineer's roadmap, developing a strong understanding of indexing embeddings is essential, since it is often integral to building models that deal with high-dimensional data and require effective computation methods. Learning how indexing embeddings work will enable an AI engineer to build efficient systems involving similarity searches and recommendation engines.
