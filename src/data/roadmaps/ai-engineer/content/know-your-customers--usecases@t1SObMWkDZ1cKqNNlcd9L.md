# Know your Customers / Usecases

In the landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) engineering, understanding your target customers and use-cases is a fundamental milestone. This knowledge informs the decisions made during the development process to ensure that the final AI solution appropriately meets the relevant needs of the users. The term 'use-case' typically refers to a list of actions or event steps necessary to achieve a particular goal. Reflecting its overall significance, this early comprehension of customers and use-cases plays a pivotal role in shaping the direction of AI solutions, defining their scope and objectives, and ultimately determining their success or failure in the market.
