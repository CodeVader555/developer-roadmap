# Manual Implementation

Manual Implementation in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) involves coding algorithms, data structures, and mechanisms from scratch without the help of pre-built functions or libraries. It provides a deeper understanding of how AI algorithms work, how data structures are built, and how mechanisms execute. Although frameworks, libraries, and tools simplify and speed up AI development, knowing how to implement AI models manually helps an AI engineer to customize and optimize models to achieve specific project results.
