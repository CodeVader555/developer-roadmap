# Multimodal AI Usecases

Multimodal AI Usecases refer to the application of Multimodal Artificial Intelligence in different spheres. Essentially, Multimodal AI is a subfield of AI that combines different types of data input (such as visual images, sonic waveforms, and unstructured text) to improve system efficiency, performance, and output. For an AI Engineer's roadmap, understanding these use-cases not only provides a perspective on how AI can be utilized in multi-faceted ways, but also opens up novel avenues for innovation. From healthcare, where it can help in better diagnosis by analyzing medical reports and scans, to the automotive industry, where it can work to enhance self-driving technologies by processing live images, sounds etc., Multimodal AI has myriad potential applications, making it a vital learning area for any aspiring AI engineer.
