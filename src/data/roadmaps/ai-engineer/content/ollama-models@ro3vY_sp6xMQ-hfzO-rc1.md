# Ollama Models

Ollama includes popular options like `Llama 2, Mistral, and Code Llama`. It simplifies the deployment process by bundling model weights, configurations, and datasets into a single package managed by a `Modelfile`, allowing users to easily manage and interact with these models. The platform's extensive library allows users to choose models tailored to their specific needs, and reduces reliance in cloud. Ollama Models could be of `text/base`, `chat/instruct` or `multi modal`.
