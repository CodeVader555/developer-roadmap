# Open-Source Embeddings

Open-source embeddings, such as Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText, are essentially vector representations of words or phrases. These representations capture the semantic relationships between words and their surrounding context in a multi-dimensional space, making it easier for machine learning models to understand and process textual data. In the AI Engineer Roadmap, gaining knowledge of open-source embeddings is critical. These embeddings serve as a foundation for natural language processing tasks, ranging from sentiment analysis to chatbot development, and are widely used in the AI field for their ability to enhance the performance of machine learning models dealing with text data.
