# Open vs Closed Source Models

Open source models are types of software whose source code is available for the public to view, modify, and distribute. They encourage collaboration and transparency, often resulting in rapid improvements and innovations. Closed source models, on the other hand, do not make their source code available and are typically developed and maintained by specific companies or teams. They often provide more stability, support, and consistency. Within the AI Engineer Roadmap, both open and closed source models play a unique role. While open source models allow for customization, experimentation and a broader understanding of underlying algorithms, closed source models might offer proprietary algorithms and structures that could lead to more efficient or unique solutions. Therefore, understanding the differences, advantages, and drawbacks of both models is essential for an aspiring AI engineer.
