# OpenAI Moderation API

OpenAI Moderation API is a feature or service provided by OpenAI that helps in controlling or filtering the output generated by an AI model. It is highly useful in identifying and preventing content that violates OpenAIâ€™s usage policies from being shown. As an AI engineer, learning to work with this API helps implement a layer of security to ensure that the AI models developed are producing content that aligns with the ethical and moral guidelines set in place. Thus, it becomes a fundamental aspect of the AI Engineer Roadmap when dealing with user-generated content or creating AI-based services that interact with people.
