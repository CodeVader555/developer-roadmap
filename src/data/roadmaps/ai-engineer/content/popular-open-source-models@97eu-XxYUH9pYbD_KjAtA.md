# Popular Open Source Models in AI

Open-source models consist of pre-made algorithms and mathematical models that are freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. In the realm of Artificial Intelligence, these models often include frameworks for machine learning, deep learning, natural language processing, and other AI methodologies. Thanks to their openly accessible nature, AI engineers often utilize these open-source models during project execution, fostering increased efficiency by reducing the need to create complex models from scratch. They serve as a valuable resource, often speeding up the development phase and promoting collaboration among the global AI community. Popular examples include TensorFlow, PyTorch, and Keras, each offering unique strengths and capabilities for different areas of AI engineering.
