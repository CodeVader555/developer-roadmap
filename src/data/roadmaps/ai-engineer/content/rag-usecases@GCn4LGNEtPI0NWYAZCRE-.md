# RAG Usecases

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a type of sequence-to-sequence model with documents retrievers in their architecture. This method integrates the power of pre-trained language models and extractive question answering methods to answer any queries with high precision. In the AI Engineer Roadmap, this tool has practical applications, such as enabling machines to provide detailed responses based on large-scale databases instead of generating responses only from a fixed context. This feature is highly beneficial in developing advanced AI systems with extensive knowledge recall capabilities. RAG's use-cases cover areas like customer service chatbots, automated legal assistance, healthcare advice systems, and other areas where comprehensive information retrieval is crucial.
