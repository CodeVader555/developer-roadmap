# RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

RAG is a paradigm for applying transformer-based generative models in Natural Language Processing tasks. It leverages a hybrid approach, i.e. it combines the capabilities of pre-trained language models and powerful retrieval methods to generate responses. For an AI Engineer, RAG forms an essential part of the NLP (Natural Language Processing) toolkit. This model operates by first retrieving relevant context from a large corpus, and then utilizing this context to generate detailed and contextually rich responses. Its successful application spans across a multitude of NLP tasks including machine translation, dialogue systems, QnA systems, and more. Therefore, RAG is a significant stop on the route to becoming an accomplished AI engineer as it equips them with skills to deal with complex NLP tasks efficiently.
