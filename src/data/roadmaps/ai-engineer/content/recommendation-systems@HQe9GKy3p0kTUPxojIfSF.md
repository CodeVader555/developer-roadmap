# Recommendation Systems

Recommendation systems are a subclass of information filtering systems that are meant to predict the preferences or ratings that a user would give to a particular item. Broadly speaking, these systems are primarily used in applications where a user receives suggestions for the products or services they might be interested in, such as Netflix's movie recommendations or Amazon's product suggestions. In terms of an AI Engineer Roadmap, building recommendation systems is a fundamental skill, as these systems typically utilize concepts of machine learning and data mining, and their purpose primarily revolves around making predictions based on large volumes of data. These skills make an integral part of AI-related fields like natural language processing, robotics, and deep learning.
