# Robust Prompt Engineering

Robust prompt engineering refers to designing, refining, and optimizing the instructions or queries given to an AI model to execute specific tasks. Originally, AI models were trained on a wide range of internet text without any specific commands. However, it can be more effective to provide these models with explicit prompts to guide their responses or actions. Prompt engineering aids in shaping the output of an AI model, significantly improving the accuracy of its responses. This becomes particularly valuable for AI engineers when working on state-of-the-art models like GPT-3, where the output's quality and relevance can be heavily influenced by innovative and well-structured prompts. With robust prompt engineering, AI practitioners can better channel the model's raw capabilities into desired outcomes, marking a crucial skill in an AI Engineer's journey.
