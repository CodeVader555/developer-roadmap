# Transformers.js

Hugging Face Transformers.js is a JavaScript library that enables developers to run transformer models directly in the browser without requiring a server. It offers a similar API to the original Python library, allowing tasks like sentiment analysis, text generation, and image processing using pre-trained models. By supporting the `pipeline API`, it simplifies the integration of models with preprocessing and postprocessing functionalities.
