# Transformers.js

Transformers.js is a JavaScript library providing the ability to use machine learning transformers in applications. It is based on the concept of attention mechanism - "transformers" in artificial intelligence, which allows the model to focus on different words in a sentence during translation or text generation tasks. The benefits of using such transformers are their capacity to handle long sequences of data and their parallelization abilities which offer faster computational time. In the AI Engineer's learning pathway, understanding and working with transformers can be pivotal as they form a fundamental part of natural language processing tasks, often used within AI solutions. With JavaScript being a language of choice for many web applications, having an understanding of Transformers.js provides an AI engineer with the knowledge necessary to integrate powerful language models directly within web-applications.
