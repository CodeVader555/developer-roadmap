# Vector Database

A Vector Database is a tool that specializes in storing and efficiently retrieving vector representations (or embeddings). These vectors often represent embeddings of items or entities in high-dimensional space. This indexation process enables search and clustering algorithms. In this step of implementing RAG, we use a Vector Database to store the embeddings of the documents.
