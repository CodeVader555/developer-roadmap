# Weaviate

Weaviate is an open-source, GraphQL and RESTful API-based, knowledge graph that allows you to store, search, and retrieve data. One of its core features is machine learning algorithms that enhance information handling. For an AI Engineer, mastering Weaviate becomes relevant as it bridges the gap between unstructured data and structured data, which is a common challenge when working with AI and machine learning models. By understanding this, an AI engineer can leverage these abilities to manipulate structured data more effectively, optimize data searchability, and improve the efficiency of data-dependent processes in AI projects.
