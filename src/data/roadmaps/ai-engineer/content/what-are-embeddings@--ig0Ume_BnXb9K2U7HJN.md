# What are Embeddings

Embeddings are a way of representing complex and high-dimensional data in a low-dimensional space, typically a vector. For example, words in a language can be represented as multi-dimensional vectors through word embedding techniques, such as Word2Vec or GloVe. These representations capture semantic relationships among words that machines can understand and process. In the roadmap of becoming an AI Engineer, handling and understanding embeddings is vital because they are essential to natural language processing, recommendation systems and any AI component that deals with complex data in a compact, meaningful manner.
