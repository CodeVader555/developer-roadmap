# Basics of Computer Networking

Computer networking involves connecting multiple computers and devices to share resources, such as data, applications, and internet connections. Networks can range from small local area networks (LANs) to large-scale wide area networks (WANs), such as the internet. The basic components of a network include devices (computers, servers, routers), transmission media (wired or wireless), and network protocols, which govern communication between devices.

Key concepts in networking include:

1. **IP Addressing**: Every device on a network has a unique Internet Protocol (IP) address, which allows it to be identified and communicate with other devices.
2. **Subnetting**: This involves dividing a network into smaller, manageable sections to optimize performance and security.
3. **Routing**: Routers are used to forward data between different networks, ensuring that information reaches the correct destination.
4. **DNS**: The Domain Name System translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, enabling easier navigation and communication on the internet.
5. **TCP/IP Protocol**: The Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite is the foundation of most networks, handling how data is broken into packets, transmitted, and reassembled.
