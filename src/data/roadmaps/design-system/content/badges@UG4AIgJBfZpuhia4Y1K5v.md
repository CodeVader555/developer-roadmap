# Badges

Badges are small status indicators that communicate information about objects or actions, providing immediate visual feedback to help users quickly understand states, quantities, or categories within an interface. Effective badge design should include numeric indicators for notifications and counts with clear visibility, create status badges that communicate states with distinct colors aligned to semantic color systems, develop category labels for content organization that maintain scannable hierarchy, define interactive states with appropriate visual feedback and accessibility considerations, provide multiple size variations that work harmoniously with different components while maintaining legibility, ensure integration with semantic color systems using sufficient contrast ratios, establish consistent positioning rules relative to other elements including corner placement and z-index considerations, define content guidelines for character limits and messaging standards, include proper accessibility with ARIA labels and screen reader support, and implement subtle animations that enhance usability without causing distraction or accessibility issues.
