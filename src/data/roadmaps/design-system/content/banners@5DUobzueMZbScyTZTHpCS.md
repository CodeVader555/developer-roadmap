# Banners

Banners are prominent messaging components used to communicate important information, announcements, or system status to users, typically appearing at the top of pages or sections for high visibility. They should support different message types with distinct visual treatments, offer various positioning options, provide clear dismissal mechanisms with optional auto-dismiss timers, include relevant primary and secondary actions, use consistent iconography for message reinforcement, adapt appropriately on mobile devices without overwhelming the viewport, feature subtle animations for state changes, follow clear content guidelines for messaging and character limits, ensure proper accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation, and include stacking rules for handling multiple simultaneous banners with proper priority systems.
