# Buttons

Buttons are fundamental interactive elements that enable users to perform actions and make choices, requiring careful design with clarity, accessibility, and consistency in mind. They should establish clear visual hierarchy with primary, secondary, and tertiary styles, provide comprehensive interactive states including hover, focus, active, loading, and disabled with smooth transitions, offer multiple size variations for different interface contexts, support icon integration with proper spacing and accessibility, follow content guidelines for character limits and messaging, ensure minimum 44px touch targets on mobile devices, implement loading indicators that maintain button dimensions, adapt responsively across screen sizes, include proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support, and feature subtle animations that enhance user experience without causing distraction.
