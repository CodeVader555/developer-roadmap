# Color

Color is one of the most fundamental design tokens in a design system, establishing brand identity, visual hierarchy, and user experience through a well-structured system that ensures consistency and accessibility across all touchpoints. A comprehensive color system should organize colors into logical groups including primary, secondary, neutral, and semantic colors with systematic naming conventions, ensure all combinations meet WCAG AA accessibility standards, support both light and dark theme variations with semantic tokens, create meaningful color categories for states that maintain consistency across components, establish systematic color naming and organization that scales effectively, balance brand expression with functional requirements, define consistent approaches to gradients and visual effects, provide clear usage documentation with visual examples, account for cultural color associations for global audiences, and offer colors in multiple formats optimized for different platforms and development workflows.
