# Dropdowns

Dropdowns are selection components that reveal a list of options when activated, providing an efficient way to present choices while conserving screen space for navigation and form interactions. They should feature clear clickable triggers with proper visual indicators, organize options with grouping and hierarchy for improved scannability, include search and filtering for long option lists, support multi-selection patterns with clear state indicators, implement smart positioning that handles viewport constraints automatically, provide full keyboard navigation including arrow keys and type-ahead functionality, offer loading states with skeleton placeholders for dynamic content, adapt for mobile with full-screen overlays or native picker integration, ensure proper accessibility with ARIA attributes and screen reader announcements, and implement performance optimizations like virtualization for large datasets.
