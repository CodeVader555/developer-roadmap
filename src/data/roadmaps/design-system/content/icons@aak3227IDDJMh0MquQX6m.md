# Icons

Icons are visual symbols that communicate meaning quickly and efficiently, serving as universal language elements in user interfaces to enhance usability and reduce cognitive load. They should maintain consistent visual style across all icons including line weight and corner radius, be designed on a consistent grid system with standardized alignment rules, provide multiple size options optimized for different contexts, organize into logical semantic categories with clear naming conventions, ensure accessibility with proper contrast and screen reader support, consider cultural neutrality for global audiences, be available in multiple optimized formats for different platforms, include interactive states with appropriate visual feedback, establish contextual usage guidelines for when to use icons alone or with text, and implement systematic versioning processes to maintain consistency as the library evolves.
