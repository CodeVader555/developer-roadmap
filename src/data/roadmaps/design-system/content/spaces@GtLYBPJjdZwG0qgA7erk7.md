# Spacing

Spacing tokens define the white space and distances between elements in your design system, creating visual rhythm, improving readability, and establishing clear relationships between interface components through consistent application. An effective spacing system should establish a foundational spacing unit that serves as the building block for all spacing decisions, create a systematic spacing scale that provides predictable options for different layout needs, define consistent internal component spacing that maintains proper proportions and accessibility, establish guidelines for spacing between major layout areas and sections, implement fluid spacing that adapts appropriately across screen sizes while maintaining proportional relationships, create meaningful spacing categories that correspond to different content densities, maintain consistent vertical spacing that aligns with typography baseline grids, ensure adequate spacing around interactive elements to prevent accidental interactions and improve touch usability, align spacing tokens with grid systems for cohesive layouts, and ensure spacing values translate appropriately across different platforms while accounting for platform-specific interaction patterns.
