# Usage Guidance

Logo usage guidance provides comprehensive rules and examples for proper logo implementation, helping maintain brand consistency while preventing common misuses that can dilute brand impact and recognition. Effective usage guidance should establish clear visual examples of proper logo usage alongside common mistakes to avoid, define when to use different logo variations based on context and space constraints, specify approved color combinations and contrast requirements, clearly prohibit unauthorized alterations including rotation and distortion, provide usage rules for different contexts including digital and print applications, define co-branding standards with proper hierarchy and spacing, establish quality standards including resolution and file format requirements, create approval processes for new contexts and partnerships, include trademark and legal usage guidelines, and provide fallback solutions for challenging contexts where standard usage isn't possible while maintaining brand integrity.
