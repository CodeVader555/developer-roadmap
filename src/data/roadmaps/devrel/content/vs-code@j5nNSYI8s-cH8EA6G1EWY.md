# VS Code

Visual Studio Code (VSCode) was first announced by Microsoft in 2015 and quickly became one of the most popular and widely used Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). Built on [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), a framework that allows web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create desktop applications, VSCode offers a lightweight and highly extensible platform for developers. VSCode focuses on being a streamlined code editor with the ability to install extensions that add features such as debugging, version control, and language-specific tooling. Microsoft's vision was to create a flexible environment that could cater to all types of developers, from beginners to seasoned professionals.
