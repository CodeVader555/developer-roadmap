# Architecture documentation

Engineering Managers play an instrumental role in overseeing architecture documentation. These documents outline the systems design, essential for creating a concrete base before initiating projects. The manager ensures that the document is accurate, clear, and comprehensible. Challenges can include adapting to system changes and ensuring all modifications are appropriately documented. Exceptional communication skills, project management, and technical understanding of software architecture are fundamental skills in this area. The ultimate aim is to facilitate team understanding of system architecture via effective and updated documentation to promote efficient workflows.
