# Best Practices

Ensuring best practices in documentation is a crucial part of an Engineering Manager's responsibilities. They're tasked with promoting clear, concise, and easily navigable documents that increase efficiency and avoid miscommunication within the team. Potential challenges include maintaining consistency, accuracy, and relevance in growing codebases. To face these, Managers often implement standardization protocols, provide training on documentation guidelines, and regularly review and update existing documents. Success in this area calls for good communication skills, attention to detail, and a love for clarity and organisation.
