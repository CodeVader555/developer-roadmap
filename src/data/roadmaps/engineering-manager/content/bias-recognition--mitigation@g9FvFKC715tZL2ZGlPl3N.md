# Bias Recognition / Mitigation

For an Engineering Manager, spotting and mitigating bias in the team culture is essential. It's their responsibility to ensure a fair, respectful environment where decisions are made based on merit, not prejudice. They face the challenge of identifying both obvious and subtle forms of bias, which might be ingrained subtly in team dynamics or processes. Critical thinking, open communication, and training in diversity, equity, and inclusion are needed to succeed. Strategies to address these challenges may include bias training sessions, revisiting company policies, or utilizing feedback systems.
