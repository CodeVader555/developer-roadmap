#  Blameless Post-mortems

As an Engineering Manager, it's your task to facilitate a blameless post-mortem after an incident. This allows your team to understand what went wrong and how to prevent it from happening again. The key responsibility is to create a safe environment where team members feel comfortable sharing mistakes. Emphasize on learning, not pointing fingers. You deal with challenges to this process by openly discussing fears and concerns of blame. A successful manager applying blameless post-mortems is non-judgmental, understanding that errors are usually a set of coincidences and system issues, not individual failures.
