# Board presentations

Engineering Managers often find themselves presenting to a board, providing updates on project performance, resourcing needs, and technical strategy. This requires excellent communication skills to convey complex issues in a simple and understandable manner. An Engineering Manager must distill technical jargon into meaningful insights for non-technical board members. Preparing in advance, employing data visualizations, and speaking with confidence enhances clarity and comprehension. They also need resilience to navigate tough questions or critique. Itâ€™s a challenging but vital process aiding strategic decision-making and fostering trust between engineering and executive teams.
