# Budget requests

An Engineering Manager plays a crucial role in budget requests. They prepare and present solid budgets justified by well-articulated business goals and priorities. They have a key responsibility to align executive decision-makers with engineering team needs. They can face challenges in making their case compelling and defending their estimates. Therefore, they need to be adept at translating technical jargon into effective business language, showing how the requests are integral to the company's development and success. It requires a deep understanding of both engineering principles and corporate finance.
