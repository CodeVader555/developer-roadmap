# Build vs Buy Evaluation

Engineering Managers play a pivotal role in the "Build vs Buy" evaluation process. They weigh the cost, time, and resources needed to build a solution in-house versus purchasing a third-party solution. Key responsibilities include understanding the team's capability to integrate or build the solution, calculating the total cost of ownership, and assessing the alignment with the team's technical strategy. Challenges they face include potential lack of knowledge about market offerings and skills required to integrate/built the solution. Evaluating these aspects demands a strategic mindset, technical expertise, and precise judgement.
