# Business continuity

An Engineering Manager shoulders the responsibility of business continuity, ensuring the teamâ€™s functionality isn't disrupted, especially during unforeseen circumstances. This involves initiating contingencies like remote working, split operations, or alternative task assignments. The manager faces challenges in maintaining communication lines and keeping the team motivated. Success requires strategic planning, adaptability, and robust communication skills. It's vital not to overlook the human element while juggling resources and technical needs. Remember that maintaining regular touchpoints and showing empathy towards team members' individual situations goes a long way in sustaining business continuity.
