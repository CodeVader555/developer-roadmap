# Business continuity

An Engineering Manager is heavily involved in ensuring business continuity in times of unexpected events. They leverage technical expertise to plan and implement solutions that allow for uninterrupted service, often considering large-scale, system-wide risks. Key responsibilities include creating backup and recovery strategies and readiness testing. Balancing robustness and cost-effectiveness is one major challenge that can be addressed with a cybernetics-focused approach and risk analysis skills. These managers also facilitate clear communication to ensure everyone understands the continuity protocols, thereby enhancing a culture of preparedness and resilience.
