# Change management

Engineering Managers play a crucial role in change management within the organization. They are responsible for implementing changes effectively, ensuring teams are prepared for the transition, and reducing any potential disruptions. The task might be arduous, owing to resistance from team members, unforeseen challenges, or shortcomings in planning. To successfully navigate these, a manager needs excellent communication and leadership skills. Furthermore, adopting a systematic approach can help them understand the implications of changes, devise effective strategies, and inspire their team to embrace the new processes.
