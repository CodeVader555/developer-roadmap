# Change strategy

An Engineering Manager plays a crucal role in the development and implementation of a change strategy during organizational change. Crafting a clear, achievable strategy is key, with an emphasis on careful planning, communication, and responsiveness. An Engineering Manager must navigate potential resistance to change, help their team adapt, and ensure normal operations are maintained during the transition. Clear goal-setting, empathy, and strong interpersonal skills matter. Frequent evaluation of the strategy is also needed to make necessary adjustments and keep the whole team aligned with the new direction.
