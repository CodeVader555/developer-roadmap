# CI/CD Implementation

An Engineering Manager has the responsibility to ensure smooth CI/CD implementation. This involves understanding its practicality in a continuous workflow, and determining the right tools to integrate. Challenges might rise, such as inadequate skills among team members. To address this, managers should advocate for relevant training. An EM's role in CI/CD is crucial in minimizing bugs due to manual processes, enhancing code maintainability, and reducing software delivery time. Successful implementation requires good communication, decision-making abilities, and an adequate understanding of DevOps culture and practices.
