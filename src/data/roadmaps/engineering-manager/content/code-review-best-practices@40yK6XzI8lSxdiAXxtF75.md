# Code Review Best Practices

An Engineering Manager plays a pivotal role in establishing code review best practices. They are responsible for ensuring all developers adhere to these standards to maintain code quality and address potential issues early. This often includes enforcing coding conventions, periodic peer reviews, and proper documentation. One major challenge is ensuring every team member understands and follows these practices without feeling micromanaged. Success here requires a blend of technical expertise, team management skills, and an open communication style to facilitate effective dialogue about code quality.
