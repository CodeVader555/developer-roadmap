# Communication planning

An Engineering Manager plays an instrumental role in communication planning during organizational change. They shoulder the responsibility of developing and delivering clear, concise messages that efficiently address the modifications taking place. The challenge here is ensuring that everyone understands the implications of the change and dispelling any misconceptions. Accuracy, consistency, and timing are essential elements of successful communication planning. To thrive, managers must possess excellent interpersonal skills, strong presentation abilities, and a solid understanding of the overall system dynamics.
