# Conflict Resolution

A crucial duty for an Engineering Manager is to manage conflict within the team. This requires tact, empathy, and a deep understanding of group dynamics. Managers should take an active role in mediating disagreements, aiming to strike a balance between different perspectives. By fostering an environment where all voices are heard, they prevent misunderstanding and resentment from escalating. Addressing challenges involves deciphering root causes and implementing fair solutions, a task requiring keen judgment. Skills such as active listening, open communication, and decisiveness play a critical role in successful conflict resolution.
