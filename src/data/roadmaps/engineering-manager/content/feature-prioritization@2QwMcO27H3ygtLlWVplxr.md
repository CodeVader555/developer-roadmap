# Feature prioritization

Feature prioritization is a crucial responsibility for an Engineering Manager in relation to customer relations. It involves assessing customer needs and feedback alongside business goals to define the product's development roadmap. Challenges include balancing diverse customer requests, industry trends, and resource constraints. Successful Engineering Managers need to exhibit strong critical thinking and negotiation skills to prioritize features that deliver maximum value. They can use methodologies like RICE or MoSCoW and collaborate closely with Product Management and Customer Success teams to ensure customer satisfaction and product success.
