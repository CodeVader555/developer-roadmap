# Milestone Management

Milestone management is critical for an Engineering Manager to ensure project development evolves in a timely manner. Their main tasks involve defining key project phases, setting achievable deadlines, and tracking progress. To overcome challenges such as timeline adjustments or project pivots, they need strong communication skills, timeliness, and an understanding of the technical aspects of the project. By effectively managing milestones, they can align their team's efforts, minimize project risk, and achieve successful project completion. Their skill in milestone management significantly impacts a project's pace and success.
