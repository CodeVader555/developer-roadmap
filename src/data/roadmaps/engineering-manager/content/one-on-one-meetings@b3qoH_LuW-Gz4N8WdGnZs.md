# One-on-One Meetings

An Engineering Manager holds key responsibility in creating a strong feedback loop through one-on-one meetings. This requires them to nurture an environment of trust and empathy. Challenges include maintaining regular schedules and addressing sensitive topics. Resolving these needs diplomatic skills, active listening, and thoughtful structuring of each session. Successful managers are those who see these meetings as both a chance to identify potential issues ahead of time as well as a platform for personal development and recognition for their team members.
