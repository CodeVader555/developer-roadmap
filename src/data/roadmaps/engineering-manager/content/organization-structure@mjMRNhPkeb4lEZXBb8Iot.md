# Organization structure

An Engineering Manager should have a comprehensive understanding of the organization's structure. They must know who holds what responsibility, how roles and responsibilities are distributed, and how information flows between different layers. This understanding assists in effective delegation, reduces redundancy, and streamlines communication. Furthermore, they can identify and address gaps or overlaps in the structure, optimizing performance and productivity. They need to communicate effectively and diplomatically to handle any structure-related issues or reorganizations. Experiences in diverse teams often help enhance this understanding.
