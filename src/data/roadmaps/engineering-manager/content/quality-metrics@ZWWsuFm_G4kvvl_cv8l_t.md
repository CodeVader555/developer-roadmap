# Quality Metrics

Quality Metrics are key indicators that an Engineering Manager utilizes to gauge the standard of a project. It's their responsibility to select the right metrics for measuring the project's quality, like defect rates, customer satisfaction scores, or code reviews done. Challenges include determining suitable metrics and interpreting them correctly. To handle this, they need to understand the team's dynamics, the project's unique characteristics, and use data-driven decision-making. This involves skills in statistical analysis, insight synthesis, and clear communication so they can effectively share the story the metrics are telling.
