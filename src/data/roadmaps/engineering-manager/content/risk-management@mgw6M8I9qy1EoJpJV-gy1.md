# Risk Management

Risk management, an essential aspect of project management, calls for keen attention from an engineering manager. Their duty includes identifying potential project hazards, evaluating their possible impact, establishing mitigation strategies, and monitoring risk control implementation. This requires shrewd decision-making skills, accurate forecasting, continuous project assessment, and effective communication with the team. While facing challenges such as unforeseen risks or data insufficiency, the engineering manager should employ flexibility and resilience. Alone, or with a risk management team, they must keep potential repercussion at a minimal, ensuring project velocity and quality.
