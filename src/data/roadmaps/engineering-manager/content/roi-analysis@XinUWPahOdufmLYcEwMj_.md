# ROI analysis

As an Engineering Manager, executing an ROI (Return On Investment) analysis can play a pivotal role in the decision-making process. Responsibilities include estimating the cost and benefits of a project, understanding the potential returns, and then deciding if it aligns with the overall strategic goal. It can be a challenging process requiring strong financial acumen and strategic thinking. The most successful managers in this area are adept at combining financial data with their engineering knowledge, prioritizing projects appropriately, and communicating the rationale behind these decisions effectively to their team and stakeholders.
