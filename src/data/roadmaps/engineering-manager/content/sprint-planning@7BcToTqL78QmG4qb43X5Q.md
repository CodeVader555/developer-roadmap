They aim to ensure that their team members are loaded with the right amount of work, set clear goals, and understand the expectations. Challenges include determining the workload capacity of the team and mitigating potential roadblocks. Succeeding in this aspect demands sharp decision-making skills, adaptability, and effective communication.
