# Technical Debt and Management

Technical debt, if unattended, can impede the progress of engineering projects. An Engineering Manager needs to proactively mitigate this by crafting a clear strategy. Regularly auditing code for potential liabilities and implementing efficient code review processes forms an essential part of their job. They face challenges like balancing immediate product needs with long-term code maintainability and need to address them with strong communication skills, convincing stakeholders about the importance of dealing with technical debt. Furthermore, fostering a culture of writing clean, reusable code among team members can significantly reduce the accumulation of technical debt.
