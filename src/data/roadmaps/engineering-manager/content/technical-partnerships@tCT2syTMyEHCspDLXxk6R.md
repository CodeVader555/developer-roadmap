# Technical partnerships

An Engineering Manager plays a pivotal role in fostering technical partnerships, acting as the bridge between the technical team and external partners. They identify potential collaborations and ensure the team has the necessary resources to support these partnerships. Their key responsibility is to align the partnership goals with their team's technical capabilities, often requiring adept communication skills and vast technical knowledge. Challenges may arise due to varying technical standards and expectations; managers must effectively negotiate and compromise to maintain the relationship. Hence, adaptability, negotiation skills, and solid technical understanding are vital to succeed.
