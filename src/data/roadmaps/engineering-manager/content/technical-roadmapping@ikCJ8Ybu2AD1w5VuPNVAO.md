# Technical Roadmapping

Engineering Managers are integral to technical roadmapping as they plot the strategic direction for their engineering team. This demands a keen understanding of both tech trends and business objectives. Their key responsibilities include identifying necessary tech upgrades, ensuring resources can support the roadmap, and effectively communicating this to stakeholders. Challenges arise in balancing technical aspirations and business needs within a fixed timeline or budget. Especially, for successful execution, they require strategic thinking, prioritization skills, and an ability to inspire team buy-in to the technical roadmap.
