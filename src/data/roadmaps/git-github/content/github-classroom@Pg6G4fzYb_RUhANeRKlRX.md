# GitHub Classroom

Managing and organizing your class is easy with GitHub Classroom. It allows educators to track and manage assignments directly from a dashboard, automatically grade student work, and provide assistance when students encounter difficulties. GitHub Classroom leverages GitHub, the industry-standard tool used by developers, to create a seamless experience for both educators and students.

A valuable resource for understanding GitHub Classroom is this comprehensive playlist from the GitHub Education channel: [GitHub Classroom Getting Started Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVVeqIDgCvM&list=PLIRjfNq867bewk3ZGV6Z7a16YDNRCpK3u). The playlist provides a thorough introduction to using GitHub Classroom effectively.
