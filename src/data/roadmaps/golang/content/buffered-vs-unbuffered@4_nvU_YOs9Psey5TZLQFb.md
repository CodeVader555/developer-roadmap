# Buffered vs Unbuffered

Channels in Go can be either buffered or unbuffered, which affects their synchronization behavior. Unbuffered channels (created with `make(chan Type)`) provide synchronous communication - the sender blocks until a receiver is ready, ensuring tight synchronization between goroutines. Buffered channels (created with `make(chan Type, capacity)`) allow asynchronous communication up to their capacity - senders only block when the buffer is full, and receivers only block when it's empty. Unbuffered channels are useful for coordination and ensuring operations happen in sequence, while buffered channels help with performance optimization and decoupling producer-consumer timing. Understanding this distinction is crucial for designing effective concurrent systems.
