# Concurrency Patterns

Concurrency patterns in Go are established design approaches for structuring concurrent programs using goroutines and channels. These patterns provide proven solutions for common concurrent programming challenges such as distributing work, aggregating results, and coordinating multiple processes. Key patterns include fan-in (merging multiple inputs), fan-out (distributing work to multiple workers), pipelines (chaining operations), worker pools (managing a fixed number of workers), and pub-sub (publisher-subscriber communication). Understanding these patterns helps you build efficient, scalable concurrent applications while avoiding common pitfalls like race conditions and deadlocks.
