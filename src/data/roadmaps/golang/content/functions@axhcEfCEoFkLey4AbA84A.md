# Functions

Functions are the fundamental building blocks of Go programs that allow you to organize code into reusable pieces. In Go, functions are declared using the `func` keyword followed by the function name, parameters, return types, and function body. Functions can accept zero or more parameters, return zero or more values, and can be called from other parts of your program. Go functions have several unique features including multiple return values, named return values, variadic parameters, and first-class function support. Understanding functions is crucial for writing clean, maintainable, and efficient Go code.
