# Introduction to Go

Go (also known as Golang) is a statically typed, compiled programming language developed by Google in 2007 and released in 2009. Created by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson, Go was designed to address the challenges of large-scale software development at Google. It combines the efficiency and safety of statically typed languages with the ease of programming of dynamically typed languages. Go emphasizes simplicity, readability, and efficiency, making it ideal for building scalable web services, cloud applications, and system tools. Its key features include fast compilation, garbage collection, built-in concurrency support, and a comprehensive standard library.
