# Packages

Packages are Go's way of organizing and reusing code. Every Go program is made up of packages, with the main package being the entry point for executable programs. Packages group related functionality together and provide a namespace for code organization. Each package has a unique import path that identifies it, and you can import other packages to use their exported functions, types, and variables. Package names should be short, clear, and lowercase. Understanding packages is essential for structuring larger Go applications, creating reusable libraries, and collaborating with other developers through shared code.
