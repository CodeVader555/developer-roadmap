# pprof

pprof is Go's built-in profiling tool that helps identify performance bottlenecks in your applications. It can profile CPU usage, memory allocations, blocking operations, and goroutine activity. You can collect profiles programmatically using the `net/http/pprof` package or through the `go tool pprof` command. The tool generates detailed reports and interactive visualizations showing where your program spends time or allocates memory. Understanding pprof is crucial for optimizing Go applications, diagnosing performance issues, and ensuring efficient resource usage in production environments. It's an essential tool for building high-performance Go applications.
