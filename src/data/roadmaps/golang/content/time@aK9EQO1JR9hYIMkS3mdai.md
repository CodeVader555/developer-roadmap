# time

The `time` package provides functionality for measuring and displaying time, handling durations, and working with timezones. It includes types like `Time` for representing instants in time, `Duration` for representing spans of time, and functions for parsing, formatting, and manipulating temporal data. The package supports timezone-aware operations, time arithmetic, timers, tickers, and various time formats. Understanding the time package is essential for scheduling operations, measuring performance, handling timeouts, and working with timestamps in applications. It's particularly important for building systems that need to handle time-sensitive operations or work across different timezones.
