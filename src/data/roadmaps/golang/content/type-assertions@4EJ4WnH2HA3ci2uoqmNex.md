# Type Assertions

Type assertions in Go provide a way to extract the underlying concrete value from an interface. The syntax `value, ok := interfaceVariable.(ConcreteType)` attempts to assert that the interface holds a value of the specified type. If successful, it returns the value and true; if not, it returns the zero value and false. Without the second return value, a failed type assertion panics. Type assertions are essential when working with empty interfaces (`interface{}`), handling different types in the same function, and implementing type-specific behavior. They're commonly used with type switches for handling multiple possible types efficiently and safely.
