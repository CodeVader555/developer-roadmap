# Web Development

Go is an excellent choice for web development, offering built-in support for HTTP servers, efficient concurrency handling, and a rich ecosystem of web frameworks and libraries. The standard library's `net/http` package provides powerful tools for building web servers, handling HTTP requests and responses, and creating RESTful APIs. Go's performance characteristics, simple deployment model (single binary), and excellent concurrency support make it ideal for building scalable web applications, microservices, and APIs. Whether you use the standard library or popular frameworks, Go provides the tools needed for modern web development.
