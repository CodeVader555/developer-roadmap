# Authentication Logs

Authentication logs record system login events, password changes, and sudo commands, located in `/var/log/auth.log` (Debian) or `/var/log/secure` (Red Hat/CentOS). Essential for monitoring server security, detecting brute force attacks and unauthorized access attempts. Use `tail /var/log/auth.log` to view recent entries. Regular analysis ensures server security and data integrity.
