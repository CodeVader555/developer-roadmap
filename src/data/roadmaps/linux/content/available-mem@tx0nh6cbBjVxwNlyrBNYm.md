# Available Memory

Evaluating available memory is crucial for Linux system health monitoring. Use command-line tools like `free`, `vmstat`, and `top` to track memory usage and performance metrics. The `free -h` command shows total, used, free, shared, buffer/cache, and available memory in human-readable format. Essential for maintaining optimal server performance and troubleshooting resource issues.
