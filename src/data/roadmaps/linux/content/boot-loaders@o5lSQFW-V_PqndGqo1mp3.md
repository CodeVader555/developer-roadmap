# Boot Loaders

Boot loaders load the OS kernel into memory when systems start. Common Linux boot loaders include GRUB (modern, feature-rich with graphical interface) and LILO (older, broader hardware support). Boot loaders initialize hardware, load drivers, start schedulers, and execute init processes. Use `sudo update-grub` to update GRUB configuration. Enable multi-OS booting on single machines.
