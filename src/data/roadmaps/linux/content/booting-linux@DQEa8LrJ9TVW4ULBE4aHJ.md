# Booting Linux

Linux booting involves several stages: POST, MBR, GRUB, Kernel, Init, and GUI/CLI. The bootloader loads the kernel into memory, which detects hardware, loads drivers, mounts filesystems, starts system processes, and presents login prompts. GRUB configuration is managed through `/etc/default/grub` with settings like timeout and default boot options.
