# Checking Logs

Linux system logs provide chronological records of events for debugging and troubleshooting, stored in `/var/log` directory. Use `dmesg` for kernel messages and `journalctl` for systemd logs. `journalctl -u service_name` shows logs for specific services. Essential skill for system administration, monitoring, and effective troubleshooting in Linux environments.
