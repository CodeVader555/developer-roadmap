# Container Runtime

Container runtime is software responsible for running containers in Linux, providing image transport, storage, execution, and network interactions. Popular options include Docker (comprehensive ecosystem), Containerd (lightweight standalone), and CRI-O (Kubernetes-optimized). Each runtime offers specific features and benefits for different use cases in containerized application deployment and management.
