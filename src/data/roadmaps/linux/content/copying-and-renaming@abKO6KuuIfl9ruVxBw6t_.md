# Copying and Renaming Files

Essential Linux file operations use `cp` to copy files and `mv` to move/rename them. The `cp` command copies files from source to destination, while `mv` moves or renames files/directories. Both commands use the syntax `command source destination`. These case-sensitive commands are fundamental for daily file management tasks in Linux systems.
