# Creating, Updating, and Deleting Users

Linux user management involves creating, updating, and deleting user accounts for system security and resource management. Use `useradd` or `adduser` to create users, `usermod` to update user details like home directory or shell, and `userdel` to delete users. Effective user management maintains system security and organization in multi-user environments.
