# Creating Services

Creating Linux services involves setting up background applications using systemd service files. Services run continuously performing essential tasks like web servers, databases, and mail servers. Create `.service` files in `/etc/systemd/system/` with Unit, Service, and Install sections. Control services using `systemctl` commands. Best practice: avoid running services as root for security.
