# Docker

Docker is an open-source containerization platform that uses OS-level virtualization to package applications with dependencies into lightweight containers. In Linux, Docker containers share the kernel and use features like namespaces and cgroups for isolation. This provides less overhead than traditional VMs while enabling consistent deployment across environments. 

Here's a basic example of running an application (for example, hello-world) with Docker on Linux:

```bash
# Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub
sudo docker pull hello-world

# Run the Docker container
sudo docker run hello-world
```

The above commands allow you to download a Docker image and run it on your Linux system, providing the foundation for deploying containers in development, testing, and production environments.
