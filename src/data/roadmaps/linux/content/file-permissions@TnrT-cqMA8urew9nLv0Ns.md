# File Permissions

Linux file permissions control read (r), write (w), and execute (x) access for owner, group, and others using octal or symbolic notation. Format `-rwxr--r--` shows file type and permissions. Use `chmod` to change permissions, `chown` for ownership, `chgrp` for group ownership. Essential for system security and proper access control.
