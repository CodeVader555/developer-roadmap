# Finding and Installing Packages

Linux package managers like `apt`, `yum`, and `dnf` automate software installation, upgrading, configuring, and removal. Debian-based systems: `sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install package-name`. Fedora/CentOS: `sudo dnf update && sudo dnf install package-name`. Package management eliminates manual compilation from source code. Root permissions required for installation.
