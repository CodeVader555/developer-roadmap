# GREP

GREP (Global Regular Expression Print) is a powerful text search utility that finds and filters text matching specific patterns in files. It searches line by line and prints matching lines to the screen. Essential for shell scripts and command-line operations. Example: `grep "pattern" fileName` searches for specified patterns. Alternative: `ripgrep` offers enhanced performance and features.

An essential part of many shell scripts, bash commands, and command-line operations, GREP is a versatile tool that comes pre-installed with every Linux distribution. It embodies three main parts - format, action and regex. Over the years, it had been effectively utilized in multiple programming languages and data science applications.

Here is an example of a simple GREP command:

```bash
grep "pattern" fileName
```

This command will search for the specified pattern within the file and prints the line to the terminal.

There is also an alternative to `grep` - `ripgrep`.

`ripgrep` is an extremely fast text processor that supports all the features of `grep` and extends it.
