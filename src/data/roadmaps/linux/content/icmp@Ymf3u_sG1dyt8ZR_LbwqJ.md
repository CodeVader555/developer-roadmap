# ICMP

Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a supportive protocol used by network devices to communicate error messages and operational information. Essential for Linux network troubleshooting, ICMP enables tools like `ping` and `traceroute` to diagnose network connectivity and routing issues. Use `ping www.google.com` to send ICMP echo requests and test network reachability effectively.

In Linux systems, common command-line tools related to ICMP include `ping` and `traceroute`, both used to diagnose the state of the network and often part of troubleshooting efforts.

```bash
# Use of ICMP via the ping command to send an echo request to a specific host
ping www.google.com
```

This simple yet effective tool should not be missed out in any Linux network troubleshooting arsenal.
