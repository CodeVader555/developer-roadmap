# IP Routing

IP routing in Linux involves configuring routing tables and network routes for packet forwarding across networks. The kernel handles route selection to send packets to their destinations. Use the `ip` command (replacing deprecated `ifconfig`) for network configuration. Example: `ip route show` displays all kernel-known routes for network troubleshooting and management.
