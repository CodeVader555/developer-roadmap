# Kill Processes

The `kill` command terminates processes manually by sending specific signals to Process IDs (PIDs). Used when processes behave unexpectedly due to system bugs or accidental initiation. Syntax: `kill [signal or option] PID(s)`. Essential for Linux process management, allowing administrators to stop, pause, or terminate problematic processes and maintain system stability.
