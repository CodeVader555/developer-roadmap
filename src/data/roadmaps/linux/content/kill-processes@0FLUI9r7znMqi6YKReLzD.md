# Kill Processes

The `kill` command terminates processes manually by sending specific signals to Process IDs (PIDs). Used when processes behave unexpectedly due to system bugs or accidental initiation. Syntax: `kill [signal or option] PID(s)`. Essential for Linux process management, allowing administrators to stop, pause, or terminate problematic processes and maintain system stability.

'Kill' in Linux is a built-in command that is used to terminate processes manually. You can use the `kill` command to send a specific signal to a process. When we use the `kill` command, we basically request a process to stop, pause, or terminate.

Here's a basic illustration on how to use the `kill` command in Linux:

```bash
kill [signal or option] PID(s)
```

In practice, you would identify the Process ID (PID) of the process you want to terminate and replace PID(s) in the above command. The signal or option part is optional, but very powerful allowing for specific termination actions.
