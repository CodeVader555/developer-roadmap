# Netstat

Netstat is a command-line tool for network troubleshooting and performance measurement in Linux. It provides network statistics, open ports, routing table information, and protocol details. Use options like `-n` for numerical addresses, `-c` for continuous monitoring, and `-t`/`-u` for specific protocols. Example: `netstat -n` lists all connections with numerical values.
