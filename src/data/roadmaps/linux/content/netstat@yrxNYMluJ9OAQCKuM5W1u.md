# Netstat

Netstat is a command-line tool for network troubleshooting and performance measurement in Linux. It provides network statistics, open ports, routing table information, and protocol details. Use options like `-n` for numerical addresses, `-c` for continuous monitoring, and `-t`/`-u` for specific protocols. Example: `netstat -n` lists all connections with numerical values.

Its functionality is extended owing to various command-line options it supports, which could be used singularly or combinedly to fine-tune the output. These might include displaying numerical addresses instead of names (`-n`), continuous monitoring (`-c`), or spotting connections on a specific protocol (`-t`, `-u`). 

Here is a brief snippet of how netstat may typically be used:

```bash
# List all connections with numerical values.
netstat -n
```
