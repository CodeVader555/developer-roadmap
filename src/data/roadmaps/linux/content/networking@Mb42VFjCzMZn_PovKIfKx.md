# Networking

Linux networking enables systems to connect and share resources across different platforms. It provides robust tools for managing network interfaces, troubleshooting, and automation. Network configurations are stored in files like `/etc/network/interfaces`. Common commands include `ifconfig` (deprecated) and `ip` for interface management. Linux networking supports various protocols and scales well.

Linux adopts a file-based approach for network configuration, storing network-related settings and configurations in standard files, such as /etc/network/interfaces or /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/, depending on the Linux distribution. 

Perhaps one of the most popular commands related to networking on a Linux system is the `ifconfig` command:

```bash
ifconfig
```

This will output information about all network interfaces currently active on the system. However, please note that `ifconfig` is becoming obsolete and being replaced by `ip`, which offers more features and capabilities.
