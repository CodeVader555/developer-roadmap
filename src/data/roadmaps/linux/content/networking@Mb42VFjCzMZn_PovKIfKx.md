# Networking

Linux networking enables system connections and resource sharing across platforms with robust management tools. Network configurations stored in `/etc/network/interfaces`. Key commands include `ifconfig` (deprecated) and `ip` for interface management. Supports various protocols with excellent scalability. Essential for system connectivity and network troubleshooting.

Linux adopts a file-based approach for network configuration, storing network-related settings and configurations in standard files, such as /etc/network/interfaces or /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/, depending on the Linux distribution. 

Perhaps one of the most popular commands related to networking on a Linux system is the `ifconfig` command:

```bash
ifconfig
```

This will output information about all network interfaces currently active on the system. However, please note that `ifconfig` is becoming obsolete and being replaced by `ip`, which offers more features and capabilities.
