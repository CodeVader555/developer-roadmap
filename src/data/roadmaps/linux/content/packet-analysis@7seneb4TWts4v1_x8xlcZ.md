# Packet Analysis

Packet analysis is a key Linux network troubleshooting skill involving capturing and analyzing network traffic to identify performance issues, connectivity problems, and security vulnerabilities. Tools like tcpdump and Wireshark provide packet-level details for network diagnostics. Use `sudo tcpdump -i eth0` to capture packets on the eth0 interface for debugging network protocols.
