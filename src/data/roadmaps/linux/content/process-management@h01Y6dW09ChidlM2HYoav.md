# Process Management

Linux treats every running program as a process. Process management commands help view, control, and manipulate these processes. Key commands: `ps aux` shows running processes, `top` provides live system view, `kill -SIGTERM pid` gracefully stops processes, `kill -SIGKILL pid` forcefully terminates processes. Essential for understanding and controlling Linux system operations effectively.
