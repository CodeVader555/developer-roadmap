# Service Status

Service status shows the current state of Linux services including network processes, backend servers, and background applications. Use `systemctl status service_name` to check service states through systemd manager. Example: `systemctl status apache2.service` shows Apache web server status. Essential for diagnosing problems, maintaining performance, and preventing service downtimes.

The command `systemctl` is the predominantly used command for controlling the `systemd` system and service manager. The `status` command in conjunction with `systemctl` is particularly useful for checking the state of the service. This command allows administrators to query and control the state of a systemd system and service manager.

Here's a simple example of how to use the `systemctl` command to check the status of a service:

```bash
systemctl status apache2.service
```
This command would give status information about Apache2, the popular web server. 
By managing service statuses efficiently, Linux administrators can diagnose and rectify system problems, maintain optimum performance levels, and prevent service downtimes.
