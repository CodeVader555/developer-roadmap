# Shell Basics

The Linux shell is a command-line interface that acts as an intermediary between users and the system kernel. Common shells include Bash, sh, and csh. Basic operations involve navigating directories, creating/deleting files, and executing commands. Shell knowledge is fundamental for Linux administration, scripting, and automation tasks.

This is a follow up exercise to make your first bash script. Please run the commands in the terminal one by one and try to understand what they do:
```
touch my_first_script.sh
chmod +x my_first_script.sh
echo "date" > my_first_script.sh
./my_first_script.sh
```
