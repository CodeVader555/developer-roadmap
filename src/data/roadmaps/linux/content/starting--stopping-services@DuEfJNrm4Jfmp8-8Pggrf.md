# Checking Service Logs

System logs are essential for troubleshooting and monitoring Linux systems. Most logs are stored in `/var/log` directory and managed by systemd. Use `journalctl` to view system logs and `journalctl -u service_name` for specific service logs. The `dmesg` command displays kernel messages. Regular log monitoring is crucial for system administration.

```shell
journalctl
```

This command will show the entire system log from the boot to the moment you're calling the journal. 

To display logs for a specific service, the `-u` option can be used followed by the service's name.

```shell
journalctl -u service_name
```

Remember, understanding and monitoring your system logs will provide you a clear view of what's going on in your Linux environment. It is a vital skill worth developing to effectively manage and troubleshoot systems.
