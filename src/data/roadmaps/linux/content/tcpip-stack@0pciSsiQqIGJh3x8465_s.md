# TCP/IP Stack

TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the foundational networking protocol suite that enables computer communication over networks. It consists of four layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, and Application. In Linux, TCP/IP is integral to the OS functionality, allowing hosts to connect and transfer data across same or different networks.

Below is a basic command using TCP/IP protocol in Linux:

```bash
# To view all active TCP/IP network connections
netstat -at
```
