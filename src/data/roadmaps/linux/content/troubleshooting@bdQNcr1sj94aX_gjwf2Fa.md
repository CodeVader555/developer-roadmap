# Troubleshooting

Linux troubleshooting involves identifying and resolving system errors, hardware/software issues, network problems, and resource management challenges. Key skills include using command-line tools, inspecting log files, understanding processes, and interpreting error messages. Tools like `top` provide real-time process monitoring to identify resource-heavy processes causing performance issues efficiently.

The `top` command is a commonly used troubleshooting tool that provides a dynamic, real-time view of the processes running on a system. It can be particularly useful for identifying resource-heavy processes that could be causing performance issues.
