# Unexpand

The `unexpand` command converts spaces to tabs in text files, making documents more coherent and neat. Commonly used in programming scripts where tab indentation is preferred. Use `unexpand -t 4 file.txt` to replace every four spaces with a tab. Opposite of `expand` command, useful for standardizing indentation formatting in code files.

An example of using the `unexpand` command:

```bash
unexpand -t 4 file.txt
```
