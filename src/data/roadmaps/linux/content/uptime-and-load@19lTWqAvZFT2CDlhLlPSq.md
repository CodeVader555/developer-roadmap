# Uptime and Load

The `uptime` command shows how long a Linux system has been running and the system load average. Load average indicates computational work and CPU queue length, displayed for 1, 5, and 15-minute intervals. High load averages suggest resource constraints or performance issues. Regular monitoring helps identify usage patterns and plan capacity.

Here is an example of the `uptime` command and its output:

```bash
$ uptime
 10:58:35 up 2 days, 20 min,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
```

In the output above, "2 days, 20 min" tells us how long the system has been up, while "0.00, 0.01, 0.05" shows the system's load average over the last one, five, and fifteen minutes, respectively.
