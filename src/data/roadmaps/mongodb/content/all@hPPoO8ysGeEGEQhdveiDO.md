# $all

The $all operator in MongoDB selects documents where an array field contains all specified elements, regardless of order or additional elements. It's useful for tag-based filtering and ensuring multiple required values exist in arrays. $all performs element-wise matching and can work with arrays of different data types, making it essential for multi-criteria array filtering.
