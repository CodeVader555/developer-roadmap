# Binary Data

Binary data in MongoDB stores non-textual data like images, files, and encoded content using the BSON Binary data type. It supports various subtypes including generic binary, function code, UUID, and MD5 hashes. Binary data enables efficient storage of multimedia content, encrypted data, and arbitrary byte sequences while maintaining query and indexing capabilities within document structures.
