# BSON vs JSON

BSON (Binary JSON) is MongoDB's binary-encoded serialization format that extends JSON with additional data types like dates, binary data, and 64-bit integers. While JSON is human-readable text format, BSON provides faster parsing, compact storage, and native support for MongoDB's rich data types. BSON enables efficient storage and retrieval while maintaining JSON's flexibility and document structure.
