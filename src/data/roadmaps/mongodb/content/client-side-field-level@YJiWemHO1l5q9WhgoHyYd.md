# Client-Side Field Level Encryption

Client-Side Field Level Encryption (CSFLE) allows applications to encrypt sensitive data fields before storing them in MongoDB. The database receives only encrypted data and remains unaware of the encryption keys, ensuring zero-trust security. This feature provides deterministic and randomized encryption algorithms, enabling both exact match queries and enhanced security for highly sensitive information.
