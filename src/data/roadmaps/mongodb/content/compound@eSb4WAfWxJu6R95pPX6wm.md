# Compound Indexes

Compound indexes in MongoDB are built on multiple fields in a specified order, optimizing queries that filter on multiple fields. Field order matters significantly as it determines which queries can efficiently use the index. Compound indexes support prefix patterns, meaning they can optimize queries on any left subset of the indexed fields, making them versatile for various query patterns.
