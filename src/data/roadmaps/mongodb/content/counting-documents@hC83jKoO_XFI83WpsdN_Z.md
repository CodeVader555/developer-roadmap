# Counting Documents

Counting documents in MongoDB uses methods like countDocuments() for accurate filtered counts and estimatedDocumentCount() for fast approximate totals. countDocuments() supports query filters and provides precise results but may be slower on large collections. estimatedDocumentCount() uses collection metadata for rapid estimates, making it ideal for dashboard metrics and quick statistics.
