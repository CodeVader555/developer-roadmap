# delete() and Related Methods

Delete operations remove documents from MongoDB collections using deleteOne() for single document removal and deleteMany() for multiple documents. These methods use query filters to specify which documents to delete and support write concerns for reliability. Additional methods include findOneAndDelete() for atomic read-and-delete operations and drop() for removing entire collections.
