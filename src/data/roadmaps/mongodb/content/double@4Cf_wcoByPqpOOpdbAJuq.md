# Double

Double data type in MongoDB stores 64-bit floating-point numbers following IEEE 754 standard, providing high precision for decimal calculations. It's the default numeric type for JavaScript numbers and handles both integers and decimals. Doubles support mathematical operations in queries and aggregation pipelines, though precision limitations may occur with very large numbers or repeated calculations requiring exact decimal representation.
