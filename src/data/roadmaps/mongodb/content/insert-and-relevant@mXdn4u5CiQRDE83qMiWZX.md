# insert() and Related Methods

Insert operations add new documents to MongoDB collections using insertOne() for single documents and insertMany() for multiple documents. These methods support options like ordered/unordered inserts, write concerns, and automatic ObjectId generation. MongoDB also provides legacy insert() method and supports upsert operations through update methods when documents don't exist.
