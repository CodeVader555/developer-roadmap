# LDAP Proxy Auth

LDAP Proxy Authentication in MongoDB allows the database to authenticate users through an external LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) server, enabling organizations to integrate MongoDB with their existing directory services like Active Directory. This authentication method acts as a proxy between MongoDB and the LDAP server, allowing users to authenticate using their corporate credentials while maintaining centralized user management, making it particularly valuable for enterprise environments that need to enforce consistent security policies and user access controls across multiple systems.
