# $ne

The $ne (not equal) operator in MongoDB selects documents where a field value is not equal to a specified value. It performs inverse equality comparison and excludes documents with matching values, including exact matches and type equivalence. $ne is fundamental for exclusion filtering, finding outliers, and creating queries that avoid specific values or patterns.
