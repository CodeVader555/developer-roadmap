# $nor

The $nor operator in MongoDB performs logical NOR operation, selecting documents that fail to match any of the specified query expressions. It's the inverse of $or and returns documents that don't satisfy any of the given conditions. $nor is useful for complex exclusion logic and finding documents that don't match multiple alternative criteria.
