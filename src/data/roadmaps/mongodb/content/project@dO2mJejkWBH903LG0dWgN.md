# $project

The $project stage in MongoDB aggregation pipelines is used to reshape documents by including, excluding, or transforming fields, allowing you to control exactly which data is passed to subsequent pipeline stages. It can perform field selection (similar to SQL SELECT), create computed fields using expressions, rename fields, nest or flatten document structures, and apply various transformations like mathematical operations, string manipulations, or date formatting. The $project stage is essential for optimizing pipeline performance by reducing document size early in the pipeline, creating derived fields for analysis, formatting output for client applications, and controlling data exposure by excluding sensitive fields, making it one of the most versatile and commonly used aggregation operators.
