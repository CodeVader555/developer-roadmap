# $regex

The $regex operator in MongoDB provides regular expression pattern matching for string fields. It supports Perl-compatible regular expressions (PCRE) with options for case sensitivity, multiline matching, and extended syntax. $regex enables sophisticated text searching, pattern validation, and complex string filtering, though it may impact performance on large datasets without proper indexing.
