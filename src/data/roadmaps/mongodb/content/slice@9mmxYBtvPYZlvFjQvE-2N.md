# $slice

The $slice projection operator in MongoDB returns a subset of array elements from documents. It supports positive values for elements from the beginning, negative values from the end, and skip/limit combinations for pagination within arrays. $slice is essential for managing large arrays in documents, implementing array pagination, and reducing network traffic by returning only required array portions.
