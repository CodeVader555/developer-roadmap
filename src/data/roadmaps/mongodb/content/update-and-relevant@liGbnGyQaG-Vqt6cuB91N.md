# update() and Related Methods

Update operations modify existing documents using updateOne(), updateMany(), and replaceOne() methods with update operators like $set, $unset, $inc, and $push. These methods support upsert operations, array modifications, field updates, and atomic operations. Advanced features include findOneAndUpdate() for atomic read-modify-write operations and update pipelines for complex transformations using aggregation operators.
