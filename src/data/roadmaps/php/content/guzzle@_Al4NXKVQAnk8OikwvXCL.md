# Guzzle

Guzzle is a PHP HTTP client that simplifies making HTTP requests in PHP. It provides a straightforward and powerful way to send HTTP requests. Guzzle can simplify your life if you often handle APIs or other HTTP requests. It's great for everything from sending simple GET requests, to uploading files with POST requests, or even handling Errors using exception handling.
