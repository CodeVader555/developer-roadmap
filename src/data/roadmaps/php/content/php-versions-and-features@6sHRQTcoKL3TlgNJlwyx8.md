# PHP Versions and Features

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) versions are critically important as each release comes with new features, improvements, and bug fixes. PHP versions start from PHP 1.0 released in 1995 and have improved over the years. The more recent version as of writing is PHP 8.0, which introduced features like the JIT compiler, named arguments, match expressions, and more. Remember, sticking to officially supported versions, like PHP 7.4 or 8.0, ensures security updates and performance improvements. For instance, the code `echo "Current PHP version: " . phpversion();` would tell you the PHP version in use.
