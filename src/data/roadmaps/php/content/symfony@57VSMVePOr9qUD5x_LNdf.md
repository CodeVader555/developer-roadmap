# Symfony

Symfony is a set of PHP components and a framework for web projects. It aims to speed up the creation and maintenance of web applications and replace the recurring coding tasks. Symfony uses Composer, a PHP dependency manager, to manage its components. Below is an example of creating a new Symfony project:

```php
composer create-project symfony/website-skeleton myproject
```

This will download and install a new Symfony project in the 'myproject' directory. Symfony's components are reusable PHP libraries that will help you complete tasks, like routing, templating, or even creating form handling. More details can be found in the Symfony documentation: https://symfony.com/doc/current/index.html.
