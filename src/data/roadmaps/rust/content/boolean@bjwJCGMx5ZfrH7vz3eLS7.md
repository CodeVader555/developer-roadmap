# Boolean

Rust's `bool` primitive type represents truth values with two possible states: `true` or `false`. Booleans are used in conditional statements and logical operations like `&&` (AND), `||` (OR), and `!` (NOT). When cast to integers, `true` becomes `1` and `false` becomes `0`. Example: `let is_active: bool = true;`
