# CLI Utilities

CLI utilities are command-line tools that allow users to interact with their system through text commands. Rust is excellent for building fast, reliable CLI tools due to its memory safety and performance. Popular crates like clap and structopt help parse command-line arguments, handle input validation, and generate help messages, making CLI development efficient.
