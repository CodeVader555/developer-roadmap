# Embedded and Systems

Rust excels in embedded systems programming for microcontrollers and real-time applications. Its zero-cost abstractions, memory safety, and low-level control make it ideal for resource-constrained environments. Popular for IoT devices, firmware, and system-level programming without garbage collection overhead.
