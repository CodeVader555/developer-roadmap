Hyper is a fast, safe HTTP client/server library for Rust built on Tokio for async I/O. It supports HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 with automatic protocol negotiation. Hyper provides low-level HTTP primitives that power many higher-level web frameworks and serves as the foundation for efficient network programming.
