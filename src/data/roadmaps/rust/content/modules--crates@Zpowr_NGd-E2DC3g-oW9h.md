# Modules and Crates

Modules provide namespacing and encapsulation within a crate, organizing code with `mod` keyword and controlling visibility with `pub`. Crates are compilation units (binaries or libraries) that can depend on other crates. The module system organizes code within crates, while crates enable sharing functionality between projects.
