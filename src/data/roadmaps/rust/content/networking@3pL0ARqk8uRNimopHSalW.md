# Networking

Rust's `std::net` module provides networking primitives including `TcpStream`, `TcpListener`, `UdpSocket`, and address types. Built on BSD sockets, it offers low-level network operations for building networking applications. Higher-level crates like Tokio provide async networking capabilities.
