# Documenting with `rustdoc`

`rustdoc` is Rust's built-in documentation generator that creates comprehensive docs from code comments and source code. It can test code examples in documentation to ensure they stay accurate and up-to-date. The generated docs are viewable in a web browser and rustdoc is the standard tool for all Rust project documentation.
