# Stack

Stack is a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end. In Rust, the call stack manages function calls, with each call pushing a frame and returns popping it. Stack memory is fast but limited in size, with stack overflow occurring when exceeded.
